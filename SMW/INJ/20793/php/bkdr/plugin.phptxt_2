/**
 * Adds a callback function to a filter hook.
 *
 * WordPress offers filter hooks to allow plugins to modify
 * various types of internal data at runtime.
 *
 * A plugin can modify data by binding a callback to a filter hook. When the filter
 * is later applied, each bound callback is run in order of priority, and given
 * the opportunity to modify a value by returning a new value.
 *
 * The following example shows how a callback function is bound to a filter hook.
 *
 * Note that `$example` is passed to the callback, (maybe) modified, then returned:
 *
 *     function example_callback( $example ) {
 *         // Maybe modify $example in some way.
 *         return $example;
 *     }
 *     add_filter( 'example_filter', 'example_callback' );
 *
 * Bound callbacks can accept from none to the total number of arguments passed as parameters
 * in the corresponding apply_filters() call.
 *
 * In other words, if an apply_filters() call passes four total arguments, callbacks bound to
 * it can accept none (the same as 1) of the arguments or up to four. The important part is that
 * the `$accepted_args` value must reflect the number of arguments the bound callback *actually*
 * opted to accept. If no arguments were accepted by the callback that is considered to be the
 * same as accepting 1 argument. For example:
 *
 *     // Filter call.
 *     $value = apply_filters( 'hook', $value, $arg2, $arg3 );
 *
 *     // Accepting zero/one arguments.
 *     function example_callback() {
 *         ...
 *         return 'some value';
 *     }
 *     add_filter( 'hook', 'example_callback' ); // Where $priority is default 10, $accepted_args is default 1.
 *
 *     // Accepting two arguments (three possible).
 *     function example_callback( $value, $arg2 ) {
 *         ...
 *         return $maybe_modified_value;
 *     }
 *     add_filter( 'hook', 'example_callback', 10, 2 ); // Where $priority is 10, $accepted_args is 2.
 *
 * *Note:* The function will return true whether or not the callback is valid.
 * It is up to you to take care. This is done for optimization purposes, so
 * everything is as quick as possible.
